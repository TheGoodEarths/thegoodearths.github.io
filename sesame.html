They are a nutrient rich powerhouse packed in a tiny package. With a history of over 5,000 years of cultivation and  people from all over the world used them to get their health benefits. Sesame oil is used in cooking and Ayurvedic medicines, and more recently as an excellent moisturizer for skin and hair.</p>
									
<p>You might want to try the benefits for yourself, but you shy away from commercially produced sources due to possible additives , artificial coloured flavor and the nutrient loss involved in processing.  So you would prefer an all-natural product. Well then, let’s look at how sesame oil is produced and how you can find safe organic/cold pressed sesame seed oil for your personnel use.</p>

<p>Sesame seed oil is produced by the pressing and crushing the seeds to release their oil. There are other processing methods, most of which are manually intensive techniques and some include chemical extraction methods. As you might guess, a large number of seeds are needed to produce every ounce of oil. For 1 liter of oil we need 3 kg of sesame seed and 230 gm of palm jaggery</p>

<p>First grown in the Indus valley of India where even today the word oil (in many of the dialects and the Tamil language) refers directly to the sesame seed. Today the oil is still considered sacred and used in various religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>Sesame seed oil is now produced in China and in the Middle East, and other developing countries. But, there is a worldwide shortage of the seeds so prices for either toasted or untoasted seeds is high. <i>We in <b>“The Good Earth”</b> use black sesame seeds</i>, Cold pressed oil is the most natural and is still made using methods dating back centuries. These methods while producing a rich golden oil rich with vital nutrients is not the most efficient way to get the oil. Large stone containers and with wooded either mechanically, manually, and in some cases animal powered operated rams crush the seeds and the oil is pressed out. The darker brown oil is produced from toasted sesame seeds. Sesame oil is light sensitive and so must be kept out of direct sunlight to avoid oxidation and making the oil go rancid.
